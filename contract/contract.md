Team contract
================
Charlie Bit My Finger

## Team Goals:

-   Learn how to use data science techniques in R in order to
    meaningfully analyze data
-   Potentially reveal interesting / surprising trends within the data
    set
-   Cooperate and communicate effectively

## Individual Goals:

-   (Riley) - I would like to feel comfortable and confident with
    applying data science techniques and R programming skills without
    looking back on previous work, be able to rely on my own knowledge
    (rather than others or resources) to interpret data and
    visualizations, and have fun making connections with our data and my
    group members
-   (Oliver) - Be able to code basic functions independently without the
    support of online resources in R, discover new ways to manipulate
    data, be comfortable with larger data sets
-   (Jesse) - have fun and learn…. we are all second semester seniors!
    Also, since we are looking at Youtube data, perhaps we could find
    some cool new Youtube channels to check out

## Expectations:

-   We will have a group chat in order to coordinate group meetings
-   We will aim to set up meeting times when all three of us are
    available
-   We will try to be flexible with each other’s schedules

## Policies & Procedures:

-   Doing our best to meet all deadlines
-   Making sure to be responsive within the group chat
-   We will respect each other’s opinions
-   We will make sure that the group is a safe space for all
-   Understanding that people may have other commitments that may come
    up unexpectedly
-   We will communicate with one another about responsibilities /
    expectations for progress at the end of each group meeting
-   We will respect everyone’s skill level in R and help each other out
    if needed
-   We will respect that everyone learns at different rates

## Consequences:

-   If there’s non-performance, we will address each other
    professionally and ask for more or less involvement
-   If any group member feels that a policy/procedure of the group is
    being violated, we will communicate effectively in order to settle
    the situation
-   If conflicts that we cannot resolve ourselves do arise, we will
    consider contacting Prof. Baker about the issue
